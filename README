Description:

This program implements a blockchain based chain of custody system. Each action on an evidence item (add, checkin, checkout, remove) is stored as a block in a big blockchain file whose path follows the "BCHOC_FILE_PATH" environment variable.

Blocks are stored in a binary format using struct, with AES-encrypted case IDs and item IDs, SHA-256 parent hashes, and UTC timestamps. The program enforces the state-transition rules and prevents invalid operations to avoid foul play. To check that everything is good, you can validate the entire chain using the verify command.

All required commands are implemented: init, add, checkout, checkin, remove, show, history, summary, and verify. If anything goes wrong when running you get a non-zero error code.
